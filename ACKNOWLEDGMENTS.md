## Companion services (interoperated with, not bundled)

Odysseus talks to these over the network/API. They are **not** distributed
with this project; their licenses do not bind this codebase, but they deserve
credit:

- [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) — local model serving (MIT)
- [Radicale](https://github.com/Kozea/Radicale) — CardDAV/CalDAV server (GPL-3.0)
- [Dovecot](https://www.dovecot.org/) — IMAP server
- [isync / mbsync](https://isync.sourceforge.io/) — IMAP mailbox sync (GPL-2.0)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) — terminal multiplexer; Cookbook shells out to it on Linux/macOS for background model downloads and serves (ISC)
- [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) (`ssh`, `ssh-keygen`, `ssh-copy-id`) — Cookbook shells out to it to manage remote model servers and provision keys (BSD-style permissive)
- Model/API providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google (Gemini), DuckDuckGo

### License-compatibility notes (for the repo's own LICENSE choice)

The **core ships fully permissive** (MIT-compatible), so the two copyleft
concerns from earlier are resolved:

- **PDF text extraction** now uses **`pypdf`** (BSD-3-Clause) and **encoding
  detection** uses **`charset-normalizer`** (MIT). chardet (LGPL-2.1) has been
  removed entirely.
- **PyMuPDF (AGPL-3.0)** is no longer a core dependency. It is **optional** and
  used *only* by the PDF form-filling feature (`src/pdf_forms.py` and the form
  endpoints in `routes/document_routes.py`), lazy-imported and listed in
  `requirements-optional.txt`. The MIT core runs without it. If you choose to
  install it, AGPL's network clause then applies to *that feature* for your
  deployment (Artifex also sells a commercial PyMuPDF license that lifts this).
- **`caldav`** (Python lib) is **dual-licensed GPL-3.0-or-later OR Apache-2.0**.
  Odysseus uses it under **Apache-2.0**, which is permissive and MIT-compatible.
- **`markitdown`** (Microsoft) is **MIT** and used only as an *optional* dependency for Office/EPUB text
  extraction (`src/markitdown_runtime.py`), lazy-imported with graceful fallback — the MIT core runs without
  it. The cloud `az-doc-intel` extra is deliberately **not** installed, keeping extraction fully local.

## Thanks to

Most of Odysseus's code was written *with* AI models, not just by a human.
The project would not exist without them — credit where credit is due:

- **gpt-oss-120b** — the legend that kicked this project off.
- **Qwen3-235B**
- **DeepSeek V3.1 · DeepSeek V4 Pro · DeepSeek V4 Flash**
- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **Codex** (OpenAI)
- Friends, for helping me debug.

## This fork

This is a fork of [`pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus`](https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus)
(MIT). It adds **only** a remote-sandbox runner — [`crabbox.sh`](crabbox.sh), a
[GitHub Action](.github/workflows/crabbox-islo.yml), and
[docs/crabbox-islo.md](docs/crabbox-islo.md) — so you can run Odysseus on a
throwaway [islo.dev](https://islo.dev) microVM via
[crabbox](https://github.com/openclaw/crabbox) without installing anything
locally. All application code and credit belong to the upstream project.
